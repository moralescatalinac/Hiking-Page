            This hike was incredibly beautiful but definitely challenging. It
            required a lot of planning ahead. The total hike is 24 miles one
            way. You will descend 6,000 ft in elevation and then climb 4,500 ft
            on your way out. You will need to bring food for as many days as you
            plan on hiking, but there are plenty of water sources for hikers
            along the trails. We did this hike in 3 days, but we really felt
            like we should have stayed longer. We didnt get to spend any actual
            time at Indian Garden Campground. <br /><br />
            You will need a backcountry permit to reserve camping at any of the
            camping locations along the trail. If you plan on doing the hike in
            one day, you do not need to get a permit. When you check in for your
            hike, the park rangers will give you all the information you need to
            safely complete your journey.<br /><br />
            If you are doing the hike as a one way trip you will need to arrange
            for the

              >trans-canyon shuttle</a
            >
            to bring you from the North Rim to the South Rim or vice versa.
            Since Catalina has knee injuries we chose to do the hike from the
            North Rim to the South Rim since that is the recommended easier
            route.<br /><br />
            The campgrounds are primitive and do not include anything except the
            spot to put your tent up so you will need to be very well equipted
            with everything you need cook and eat your meals. When purchasing
            your tent you need to make sure its a light weight hiking tent and
            we really recommend bringing a sleeping pad since the hard rock is
            obviously not very comfortable to sleep in and you will want to get
            a good nights sleep to continue on the hike the next morning.Your
            backpack, when fully equipted with all your hiking needs, should not
            be any more than 30lbs and that doesnt sound like a lot of weight
            but hiking 23 miles with that much weight makes the hike even more
            difficult not taking into consideration the elevation gain and
            losses. For this hike we trained for 2 months beforehand. We worked
            out 5-6 days a week and did a lot of cardio and leg exercises.<br /><br />Visit
            the

            website for more information on the procedure for back country
            hiking. The permit is awarded on a lottery system and you must apply
            4 months before your intended stay. We stayed at Cottonwood
            Campground, and Indian Garden campground. There wasnt really
            anything special to see at Cottomwood campground but the hike out of
            there on our way to Indian Garden was incredible. Indian Garden
            campground was beautiful and we were sorry we didnt get to spend
            more time there.
